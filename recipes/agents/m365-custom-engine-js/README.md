# Govern a Microsoft 365 Agents SDK custom engine agent (TypeScript / JS)

A **custom engine agent** is the Agents Toolkit tile whose own description is *"you manage
orchestration and provide your own LLM."* Those are Microsoft's words and they are exactly the
boundary: your process hosts `AgentApplication` behind `POST /api/messages`, and the model call inside
your message handler is an ordinary provider-SDK call. Your call, your tokens, your bill — so cendor
governs it like any other call.

Pick **Custom Engine Agent** in the toolkit's *New Project* menu. The **Teams Agents and Apps**
bot/agent flavour is equivalent — same wrap map, and Microsoft's own Teams SDK guidance is "bring the
OpenAI SDK." A **Declarative Agent** is the opposite topology (Microsoft holds the model, you are
billed in Copilot Credits) and there is nothing for a token library to govern there.

```
recipes/agents/m365-custom-engine-js/
  agent.mjs         the wrap map + the host — this is the file you copy
  channelStub.mjs   a local stand-in for the channel, so this runs in CI
  index.mjs         a narrated offline run that asserts as it goes (node:assert)
```

## Run it

No key. No network. No tenant, no tunnel, no bot registration. `node index.mjs` **is** the test — a
broken governance path exits non-zero.

```bash
cd recipes/agents/m365-custom-engine-js && npm install && node index.mjs
# ...or run the TypeScript source it is generated from:
# npx tsx index.mts
```

## Expected output

```

Everything there is real: a real `AgentApplication`, the SDK's real request handler, real `TurnState`,
over a real socket. The only stand-in is the provider client — `makeClient()` returns a small async
fake, so CI costs nothing. To go live, replace its body:

```js
import OpenAI from 'openai';
return instrument(new OpenAI());        // or new Anthropic()
// Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry) — same client, v1 GA endpoint (no apiVersion):
return instrument(new OpenAI({
  baseURL: `${process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT.replace(/\/+$/, '')}/openai/v1/`,
  apiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY }));
```

Nothing else changes. `instrument()` detection is structural, not name-based.

**Driving it interactively** — the same endpoint, from the M365 Agents Playground (local, anonymous,
no tenant). Verified end to end against **`@microsoft/m365agentsplayground` 0.2.28** on 2026-08-01:
the agent answers in the Playground UI.

```bash
npm i -g @microsoft/m365agentsplayground        # or: winget install agentsplayground

# terminal 1 — the agent. Note the `cd` and the `npm install`: per-recipe installs, no workspace.
cd recipes/agents/m365-custom-engine-js && npm install
node serve.mjs

# terminal 2 — the Playground, pointed at it
agentsplayground -e "http://localhost:3979/api/messages" -c emulator
```

> ⚠️ **The `cd` is not decoration, and skipping it looks like "the recipe doesn't run".** This block
> used to be a `node -e "import('./agent.mjs')…"` one-liner, and `./agent.mjs` resolves against the

Or run the scripted smoke instead of clicking — it starts the agent, sends the Playground's own
handshake and a message Activity, and asserts a governed reply came back:

```bash
cd recipes/agents/m365-custom-engine-js && npm install && node smoke.mjs
```

## What the user actually sees: the governance card

⚠️ **The envelope is invisible in the Playground's chat pane, and that is measured, not assumed.**
Playground 0.2.28's UI projection (`convertMessage()`) forwards a fixed field set and reads
`channelData` only for `feedbackLoopEnabled`. The envelope is on the wire — the Log Panel's raw
Activity JSON has it — and a person looking at the chat sees nothing. `attachments`, by contrast,
**are** forwarded and rendered.

So the recipe ships a governance **Adaptive Card**, opt-in, off by default:

```bash
/cards on            # in the chat, any channel
M365_CARDS=1 …       # or at startup
```

It is shaped like [cendor.ai/try](https://cendor.ai/try): **one row per library, saying what that
library did on this turn, in words.** A FactSet of raw keys is a JSON dump with better spacing; what
a reviewer needs to read is *"tokenguard refused this before any call, and here is the number it
refused on"*.

```text

```

…and, more importantly, when governance refuses:

```text
  ⛔  tokenguard · refused before the call
  Refused before any model call: the estimate was $0.00003135 against $0.000001 left for this
  turn. Zero provider calls, $0 spent. The estimate reserves the full output allowance, so this can
  refuse while the session ledger still shows headroom.

  Bus feed     core        no model call was made — nothing reached the provider
```

**Four decisions in that card worth copying:**

1. **A refusal explains itself.** "The agent hit an error" is the failure this whole recipe exists
   to prevent, and a bare *"I can't do that"* is only marginally better. The card names the library,
   the number it refused on, and what it cost you ($0).
2. **The pre-flight refusal must NOT say "you reached your cap."** The estimate reserves the full
   output allowance — measured 3.04× over-reservation on one real turn — so it can refuse while the
   ledger still shows headroom. The **session-cap** refusal is a different event and does say
   exactly that. `index.mts`'s assertions cover both directions, and the second is the negative
   control for the first.
3. **The money carries its provenance.** `rate from azure as of 2026-07-01` comes from
   `prices.explain(MODEL)` (`@cendor/core` ≥ 3.6). A USD cap is only as good as the rate under it,
   and an unpriced model would print **UNPRICED — every USD guard on this turn is a silent no-op**
   instead of a comfortable-looking `$0`. See
   [`libs/prices-live-and-explain`](../../libs/prices-live-and-explain/).
4. **The card is styling; governance is not.** Plain text stays the canonical reply and the card is
   off by default, so nothing enforced depends on a channel rendering an attachment. `/cards off`
   is asserted to remove the attachment entirely.

The numbers on the card are the **same turn's** envelope values, not a second computation of them —
the test compares them against that reply's own `channelData.cendor`, keyed on the per-turn
`trace_id`. (Comparing against a *different* turn's would have passed for the wrong reason: the
offline fake is deterministic, so two turns cost the same.)

## The wrap map

| # | Where | Library | What it does in the handler |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(A)** | before any spend | `@cendor/tokenguard` `prices.estimate` | refuses a turn the remaining budget can't cover — **zero** provider calls |
| **(B)** | around the whole body | `withBudget({onExceed:'block'})` | one fuse per turn, so a tool loop's five calls share it |
| **(C)** | across turns | tokenguard + the host's `TurnState` | cumulative session cap, `Decimal`-as-string; the per-turn allowance is the *derived remainder* |
| **(D)** | every bus event | `@cendor/core` ambient + `trace()` | `conversation.id` on every `LLMCall`, and one `traceId` for the turn |
| **(E)** | mid-stream | `withBudget({onExceed:'break'})` | stops a streamed answer at the chunk where the allowance dies |
| — | on the client | `@cendor/core` `instrument()` | exact tokens, `Decimal` cost, provider + model, TTFT |
| — | in / out of the channel | `@cendor/guardrails` | injection block + PII redaction on `activity.text`; disclosure/secret gate on the reply |
| — | per turn | `@cendor/acttrace` `guard()` + `AuditLog` | hash-chained, `verify()`-able evidence, with a data-policy gate before the model |
| — | the prompt | `@cendor/contextkit` + `squeeze` | history assembled *inside* a token budget instead of concatenated |
| — | the reply | in-handler | `channelData.cendor` = `trace_id` · `cost_usd` · usage · session spend · decisions |

**`FoundryAdapter` is deliberately not used.** That adapter belongs to cendor's separate **Azure AI
Foundry** integration. The M365 Agents SDK owns its own Activity plumbing, so the envelope is three
lines on the reply Activity — using both would duplicate the host.

## Traps this recipe exists to teach

Each was measured against a real agent, and every one of them *looks* like working code.

1. **`app.onTurn('afterTurn', async () => true)` is REQUIRED — and this is the JS-only one.**
   `AgentApplication.run()` calls `state.save()` only inside `if (this._afterTurn.length > 0)`, and
   the **official nodejs quickstart registers nothing** — so `TurnState` is never persisted (its own
   `count` demo echoes `[1]` forever). The number on your envelope still *looks* plausible, because
   each turn reports its own cost; it just never accumulates, so a cumulative cap can never bind.
   `index.mjs` proves it with a **negative control**: the same agent minus that one line reports
   `$0.00001095` after two turns instead of `$0.0000219`. Python's `AgentApplication.run()` saves
   unconditionally, so this line has no Python twin.
2. **`evaluateAsync` THROWS on a block** — it does not return a decision list with
   `action === 'block'` in it. A handler that only reads the return value never sees the block; it
   escapes as an unhandled turn error and your user reads *"the agent hit an error"* instead of your
   policy's refusal. `agent.mjs`'s `gate()` catches it. Same in Python (`evaluate_async`).
3. **A third exception type.** The `acttrace` `guard()` installed at startup throws `PolicyViolation`
   from *inside* the provider call. Alongside `BudgetExceeded` and `GuardrailTripped`, that is three
   things a governed handler must expect. Report the finding's **categories**, never the matched value.
4. **`withBudget(cfg, cb)` — not `budget(cfg, cb)`.** `budget` is curried (`budget(cfg)(cb)`) and its
   two-argument overload is a deliberate compile error whose message tells you the right shape.
5. **`AsyncLocalStorage.run(value, fn)` — never `enterWith`.** On Node 20/22 an `enterWith` leaks into
   concurrent flows and is never restored on exit, and a server handling overlapping turns is exactly
   the shape that breaks on. A test green on Node 24 proves nothing about the LTS.
6. **(A) and (E) are mutually exclusive on a streamed turn.** The estimate reserves the *full*
   `max_tokens`, so any allowance small enough for the breaker to fire is already smaller than the
   estimate — the turn would be refused before a chunk existed. A streamed turn's fuse **is** the
   breaker; this recipe skips (A) there on purpose.
7. **Never word a pre-flight refusal as "you reached your cap."** The estimate over-reserves — on one
   measured turn, `$0.0000333` estimated against `$0.00001095` actually spent, **3.04×**. So (A) can
   refuse while the ledger still shows headroom. Say the request *would* exceed what is left. (In the
   run above, `preflight_refused` and `session_cap_reached` are two different sentences for that
   reason.)
8. **A cassette scope in a server must wrap the LISTENER START, not the driver.** Replay matches calls
   by a session id stamped from async-context storage, and a request handler inherits the context that
   was active when the server began listening. A scope around your client-side driver never reaches the
   handler and every call goes to the network. One scope per server lifetime also matters because the
   recorder writes the file on scope **exit** — a per-turn scope leaves only the last turn in it.
9. **Forgetting `turnScope()` fails silently.** Cost and usage stay exact; only attribution vanishes,
   with no warning.
10. **`endStream()` drains the queue itself here**; `waitForQueue()` is private. On Python **both** are
    coroutines and an un-awaited `end_stream()` is a silent `RuntimeWarning` that loses the last chunk.
11. **A second, un-instrumented client is invisible.** Budgets, gates and evidence only see calls
    through the client you wrapped. `npx @cendor/init doctor` static-checks that.
12. **A stream chunk can carry NO choices.** With `stream_options: { include_usage: true }` (the only
    way a streamed call reports real usage) OpenAI sends a **final chunk whose `choices` array is
    empty**, carrying only `usage`. Measured: **9** chunks with `include_usage`, the 9th `choices=[]`;
    **8** without it, none empty. This port reads `chunk.choices?.[0]?.delta?.content ?? ''` and so
    survives it — the Python twin used `chunk.choices[0]` and crashed on its first real streamed turn
    (fixed 2026-07-30). Keep the optional chaining; it is load-bearing, not defensive noise.
13. **The output-cap parameter is not the same on every model, and the wrong one is a hard 400.**
    The reasoning families (o-series, `gpt-5-*`) reject `max_tokens`: *"Unsupported parameter:
    'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead."* Measured
    against a Foundry deployment running `gpt-5-mini` — the Azure
    swap this recipe offers. It bites hardest on Azure because **a deployment
    name is arbitrary**: `MODEL` may be `prod-chat` with a gpt-5 behind it, so no name heuristic is
    authoritative. `agent.mjs` defaults by name, honours `OUTPUT_CAP_PARAM`, and switches once if the
    provider names the other parameter.
14. **On a reasoning model the cap covers reasoning tokens, so a small cap can return NOTHING.** Same
    deployment, `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 48`: `37 in / 48 out` with an **empty** visible reply — the whole
    allowance went to hidden reasoning. Every governance number was correct; there was simply no text.
15. **An Azure deployment name is UNPRICED, so a USD budget cannot bind to it.** The same live run
    warns: *"no price for model '<your-deployment>' … counts its calls as $0 and cannot enforce a USD cap."*
    Register a rate, use a token cap, or refuse unpriced calls. Token counts and the audit chain stay
    exact — only the money is unknown. (This is also why `index.mjs`'s `cost_usd > 0` assertion is an
    OpenAI-path assertion: against an unpriced deployment it correctly reads `$0`.)

## `$0` whole-agent CI

`index.mjs`'s last section records the model calls once, then replays **the entire agent** — HTTP →
request handler → governed handler → channel — with the cassette in `replay` mode. Same replies, byte
for byte, no key and no network. That is the CI story: your governed agent has an end-to-end test that
costs nothing and cannot flake on a provider.

No shim is needed, in either language. This port never needed one — `await` on a non-thenable is legal
in JS, so a replayed value passes straight through. The Python port did until `cendor-core` 1.14.1
taught the replay seam to honour the wrapped method's async contract; on the current shelf both ports
just write `await client.chat.completions.create(...)`.

## Before you deploy this

> ⚠️ **This host runs `/api/messages` with no configured client id, i.e. anonymous.** That is the
> supported *local* posture — it is what the Playground relies on — and an **open relay** in
> production: anyone who can reach the port can drive your agent and spend your tokens. A deployed
> agent configures a real `clientId` / `tenantId` / `clientSecret` (or a federated credential) so the
> SDK's request handler actually validates the channel's token.

Two more deployment facts, neither of them cendor's:

- **`MemoryStorage` loses the session cap on restart.** Point `new AgentApplication({ storage })` at
  Blob or Cosmos storage and the cumulative cap survives a redeploy, because it lives in the host's
  own state.
- **Publishing through the Agents Toolkit is not supported in Microsoft 365 *Government* tenants.**
  GCC / sovereign customers use the manual Azure Bot Service deploy path. (From Microsoft's
  m365-agents-sdk extensibility page — re-check its date before relying on it.)

## What this does *not* govern

`tokenguard` governs the **model meter** — which in this topology is the agent's entire AI bill.
Three other meters exist and none of them is a token meter:

| meter | whose | in scope? |
|---|---|---|
| model tokens | yours (your provider account) | ✅ this recipe |
| Azure Bot Service messages | Microsoft | ❌ see Azure pricing |
| Copilot Credits | Microsoft | ❌ a self-hosted-RAG custom engine agent never triggers them |
| hosting (App Service / Container Apps) | your cloud bill | ❌ |

And within the model meter, three honest limits:

- **Break stops spend at the chunk boundary; the channel keeps whatever it was already sent.** Queued
  chunks cannot be unsent. Whether anything was visible depends on the channel and on how long the
  answer ran — on a non-streaming channel the user simply sees the truncated answer plus the notice.
  Never claim the visible text is cut at the exact budget token.
- **The two ports disagree about which channels stream.** JS `StreamingResponse.loadDefaults` groups
  `emulator` with webchat/directline (500 ms) and gives msteams 1000 ms; Python's `_set_defaults` lists
  only msteams, webchat/directline and `deliveryMode='stream'` — **`emulator` is not a streaming
  channel there at all**. So the same break renders differently: measured with an identical break at
  142 output tokens, JS emitted 3 interim flushes on emulator and 1 on msteams, Python 0 and 2.
- **`channelData.cendor` is for the channel / your back end.** Whether a *client* surfaces it is
  client-specific. The M365 Agents Playground's **chat pane** projects `channelData` away — but its
  **Log Panel does not**: click the outbound activity (`message 201`, the agent → Playground
  direction) and the Request tab shows the whole Activity JSON with the envelope in it (measured on
  Playground 0.2.28). Assert it in a test or log it rather than depending on a client to render it.

## Orchestration layers

| layer | cost truth | note |
|---|---|---|
| plain OpenAI / Anthropic / Azure SDK | ✅ | this recipe |
| LangChain | ✅ | via `@cendor/core/langchain`'s callback handler |
| Semantic Kernel / Microsoft Agent Framework | Python-verified | the injection spikes were run on Python (SK ✅ full truth; MAF ✅ from `cendor-core` 1.14.1). Pin both versions in any claim |
| Teams SDK's own AI libraries | — | **deprecated by Microsoft**; use the OpenAI SDK pattern |
| .NET / C# | ❌ | **explicit non-goal** — there is no cendor .NET port. Never assume coverage |

Expect **two OpenTelemetry span families** from a governed agent — the hosting SDK's own
`microsoft_agents` spans alongside `cendor.core` / `cendor.acttrace`. That is additive, not a conflict.

### Exporting them (this recipe ships no OTel bootstrap, on purpose)

A hosted agent's telemetry belongs to the host application, not to a sample, so `agent.mts` sets up
no exporter. Everything it emits reaches any OTLP backend once *your* app configures one.

⚠️ **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` on its own does nothing, and the failure is silent.** Cendor's
telemetry is `mode=auto`: the emitter attaches only once a **global** provider exists. Measured on
the Python twin 2026-08-01 — with just the variable set the run is green and the collector receives
**nothing**; with the bootstrap it lands 10 calls and 45 governance events.
`CENDOR_DEBUG_TELEMETRY=1` prints which state you are in.

```ts
import { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node';
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http';

new NodeSDK({ traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter() }).start();  // the ONE global setup
```

To watch a conversation locally rather than wire a hosted backend:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 4318:4318 -v cendor-monitor-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/cendorhq/cendor-monitor:0.15.0
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
```

Cendor Monitor is optional dev tooling — no library depends on it, Cendor never operates a telemetry
endpoint, and what it shows is an **operational copy**: `verify()` runs on the audit file on your
host, never on that telemetry. See `cendor-libs/docs/observability.md`.

## Pins

The npm shelf this recipe was **live-verified against on 2026-07-30** — a record of what was run, not a
lockfile. `package.json` declares these as carets, and at `3.x` a caret spans the whole major, so a
fresh install resolves forward within major 3: a newer patch than the numbers below is expected, not
drift. All `@cendor/*` libraries share **major 3**; minors and patches are independent per package,
which is why `@cendor/contextkit` is `3.0.1` and `@cendor/acttrace` is `3.1.0`.

```
@cendor/acttrace                   ^3.1.0
@cendor/cassette                   ^3.0.0
@cendor/contextkit                 ^3.1.0
@cendor/core                       ^3.4.0
@cendor/guardrails                 ^3.1.0
@cendor/squeeze                    ^3.0.0
@cendor/tokenguard                 ^3.1.0
@microsoft/agents-activity         ^1.7.1
@microsoft/agents-hosting          ^1.7.1
@microsoft/agents-hosting-express  ^1.7.1
decimal.js                         ^10.4.3
express                            ^5.0.0
```

⚠️ **Bump the whole `@cendor/*` set together.** A sibling left on an older major resolves a *second*
copy of `@cendor/core` — a second event bus — so cross-library cooperation silently stops (a guardrail
decision never reaches the budget). `node scripts/check-one-core.mjs recipes/agents/m365-custom-engine-js`
asserts there is exactly one, and cookbook CI runs it.

The Python twin lives in the Python cookbook:
[`agents/m365-custom-engine-py`](https://github.com/cendorhq/cendor-cookbook/tree/main/recipes/agents/m365-custom-engine-py)
— same agent, same governance, a different host runtime. Full docs: [cendor.ai/docs/providers → Microsoft 365 Agents
SDK](https://cendor.ai/docs/providers#microsoft-365-agents-sdk-custom-engine-agent) — this is a **libraries**
integration, not a `cendor-sdk` one.
