# block-before-record (JS) — a call that never happened leaves nothing to replay

**The pain.** You wire a guardrail and a recorder into the same app and then have to reason about
which runs first. Get it backwards and your cassette fills with requests that were never sent — and a
later replay happily hands back a response for the exact call the guardrail exists to prevent.

**What this shows.** The ordering, as a measurement. `@cendor/guardrails` blocks **pre-flight**;
`@cendor/cassette` records on the **response**. So inside one
`cassette.using(..., { mode: 'record' })` scope, a clean prompt is sent and recorded, and a denied
prompt reaches the provider **zero** times and writes **zero** cassette entries.

## Run it

```bash
cd recipes/combos/block-before-record
npm install
node index.mjs
```

## Expected output

```text
clean request    : reached the provider, recorded
blocked request  : GuardrailTripped - guardrail "keyword_deny" blocked at stage "input": denied keyword: "wire transfer"
provider calls   : 1 (the blocked one never left the process)
cassette entries : 1 - one per call that actually happened
nothing to replay: a request that was refused has no recorded response to hand back
```

Two requests went into the scope; one call and one cassette entry came out. Both numbers are counted,
not claimed.

The consequence worth internalising: **your cassettes only contain traffic that was allowed.** A
cassette recorded in production is therefore safe to replay in CI without re-running the policy.

Call shape: `rules.keywordDeny([...], { action: 'block' })` — camelCase, and the options are an
object.
